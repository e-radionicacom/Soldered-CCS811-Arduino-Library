The CCS811 sensor is designed to measure various volatile particles in the air (TVOC - Total Volatile Organic Compounds), which include eCO2 (CO2 equivalent) and MOX (metal oxides). VOCs are generally defined as air pollutants, and can come from a variety of sources, starting with ordinary breathing, smoking, coloring, welding, and generally all processes that release particles into the surrounding air.

This sensor is often used to measure indoor air quality, which can work very well and indicate current air pollution, for example, in an office. It communicates via I2C, making it easy to connect, especially through easyC. Sensor itself should be powered for at least 20 minutes to start making accurate readings.

- Voltage: 1.8V - 3.3V
- TVOC range: 0 - 32768 ppb
- Range of eCO2: 400 - 29206 ppm
- Communication: I2C
- Dimensions: 22 x 22mm
- with two easyC connectors (https://www.soldered.com/en/easyC).
